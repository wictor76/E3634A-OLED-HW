# HP/Agilent E3634A OLED display to replace old VFD.

Original HP 34401A design was made for different OLED display. This is modified for different display pinout 
and to have USB connector pointing downwards, since I don't want to make hole to front panel display. 
Input power is also taken from front panel voltage voltage regulator.
This board could be used also in 34401A and other PSUs using similar front panel design. 

This board was designed in KiCad 5 and uses exclusively standard KiCad libraries.
